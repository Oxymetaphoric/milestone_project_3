### Project Goals


This is my milestone two project for the [Code Institute's](http://www.codeinstitute.net/) *'Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development'*. The goal of this project is to *Design, develop and implement a Back end for a web application using Python and a micro-framework.* To this end I am building a webapp utilising Flask & postgreSQL, that will alow users to create, modify, and track reviews for video games. The app will be aimed at gamers, people who are invested in tracking their relationship with videogames and offer a place for users to conveniently archive and keep a track of all the games that they have played and the thoughts that they had on them. Reviews will be abel to be tagged as public or private, and other visitors to the site will be able to browse reviews by game or by user. The site will also aggregate scores of reviews allowing users to accurately assess potential new purchases.  

#### User Goals

- browse the database of reviews 
- a place to keep track of games played
- get more information on unplayed games 

#### Site Operator Goals

- provide a reliable and secure platform for potential monetization through affiliate links 
- provide a good UX to enable growth of the userbase and accuracy of scores and breadth of database

#### Developer Goals

- develop further skill working with postgres and Flask
- develop a site that satisfies goals of the user and site operator and fulfils the project goals 
- create a good UX for users 
- build a performant and efficient site that has room for extensibility
